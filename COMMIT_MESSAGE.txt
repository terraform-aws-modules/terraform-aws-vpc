feat: modernize IPAM implementation with native Terraform resources

Replace null_resource workarounds with native AWS provider resources for IPAM
pool and subnet management. This modernization eliminates AWS CLI dependencies,
improves state management, and provides a cleaner, more maintainable implementation.

BREAKING CHANGE: Requires Terraform AWS provider >= 6.29.0

## Key Improvements

### Native Resource Implementation
- Replace null_resource with aws_vpc_ipam_pool for VPC-scoped IPAM pools
- Use aws_vpc_ipam_pool_cidr for CIDR provisioning to pools
- Replace null_resource with aws_subnet using ipv4_ipam_pool_id for IPAM-allocated subnets
- Use native aws_ram_resource_share, aws_ram_resource_association, and aws_ram_principal_association for RAM sharing
- Implement source_resource block for VPC-scoped IPAM pools

### State Management
- All IPAM resources now managed through Terraform state
- Removed file-based state management in .terraform/ directory
- Eliminated file() and fileexists() function calls
- Proper drift detection and state tracking

### Code Simplification
- Removed all bash scripts from provisioner blocks
- Eliminated sleep commands and manual wait logic
- Consolidated IPAM code into main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf
- Deleted separate ipam-subnets.tf, ipam-subnets-variables.tf, ipam-subnets-outputs.tf files
- Reduced total lines of code while maintaining functionality

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with provider version requirement and native resource approach
- Created comprehensive MIGRATION.md guide with upgrade path and examples
- Added IPAM_SUBNET_PLANNING.md with detailed feature documentation
- Created docs/CROSS_ACCOUNT_IPAM.md for cross-account scenarios
- Updated all variable and output descriptions to reflect native resources

### Examples
- Updated examples/ipam-vpc-subnets/ to demonstrate native implementation
- Created examples/ipam-vpc-subnets-cross-account/ for cross-account scenarios
- Added detailed comments explaining native resource approach
- Removed AWS CLI profile dependencies where not needed

### Backward Compatibility
- Preserved all existing variable names and types
- Maintained all existing output names and structures
- Module interface remains compatible with existing configurations
- Only breaking change is provider version requirement

## Migration Path

Users upgrading from previous versions should:
1. Update AWS provider to >= 6.29.0
2. Run terraform init -upgrade
3. Review terraform plan for resource replacements
4. Apply during maintenance window (subnets will be recreated)
5. Remove AWS CLI from execution environment (no longer needed)

See MIGRATION.md for detailed migration instructions and examples.

## Requirements Addressed

All 12 requirements from the IPAM modernization specification have been implemented:
- ✅ Requirement 1: Replace null_resource workarounds with native resources
- ✅ Requirement 2: Maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Requirement 3: Improve state management
- ✅ Requirement 4: Support VPC-scoped IPAM pools
- ✅ Requirement 5: Support IPAM-allocated subnets
- ✅ Requirement 6: Maintain RAM sharing functionality
- ✅ Requirement 7: Update examples
- ✅ Requirement 8: Remove file-based state management
- ✅ Requirement 9: Update documentation
- ✅ Requirement 10: Simplify implementation
- ✅ Requirement 11: Handle cross-account scenarios
- ✅ Requirement 12: Preserve resource lifecycle management

## Testing

- ✅ All pre-commit hooks passed (terraform fmt, terraform validate, terraform-docs, tflint)
- ✅ Both examples validate successfully (terraform validate)
- ✅ All variable and output descriptions verified
- ✅ Documentation accuracy confirmed
- ✅ Cross-account scenario documented and demonstrated

## Files Changed

### Core Module Files
- main.tf: Added native IPAM resources, removed null_resource workarounds
- variables.tf: Updated descriptions to reflect native resources
- outputs.tf: Updated descriptions to reflect native resources
- versions.tf: Updated AWS provider requirement to >= 6.29.0
